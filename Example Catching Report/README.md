# Example Catching Report

## This project served as the initial R&D report sent to the coaching staff of VCU Baseball to be presented to players

### A few notes about the data

• TrackMan Data includes 255 sample pitches from various catchers on the VCU baseball team, with attributes like pitch result, plate location (X,Y),
and time to base, etc. 

• These catching variables were used to create the strike zone plots, predicted strike characteristcs, and summary tables shown in "Group1CatchingReportUpdated.pdf"

### A walkthrough of the report

•Plot 1: Ball and Strike pitch results measured throughout the strike zone

•Plot 2: Pitch results, shaded by our own strike probability model

•Table Page: Real vs Predicted strike zone results by catcher + throwing statistics

•Plot 3: Pop time resutls by catcher, shaded by catcher throwing speed

•Plots 4-9: Plot of Ball/Strike calls for each catcher, shaded by StrikesGained model predictions
