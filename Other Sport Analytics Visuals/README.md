# Other Sport Analytics Visuals

## This folder contains a few basic ggplot visuals from my early days of R. A few of these plots served as inspiration for larger, future projects

### Plot Descriptions:

• Bonds Plot: Details the 1998 home run race between Sammy Sosa, Barry Bonds, and Luis Gonzalez, using a function that sums total home runs by date (fun.sum)

• Workman plot: Pulled Statcast data from August 2019 and plotted pitch type and pitch reslut within the strike zone object from the textbook "Analyzing Baseball Data with R"

• Devin Booker Plots: Booker bar plot exemplifies limitation of bar plots to one attribute (3PA), while density plot shows overlay capabilites when contrasting 2 or more attributes

• NBA Residual Plot: Depicts a ggplot rendering of NBA team residuals (Observed - expected wins) from 2017 - 2020. Highlighted teams show the most extreme residuals, aka the teams that over and under performed expectations that season
