# Other Sport Analytics Visuals

## This folder contains a few basic ggplot visuals from my early days of R. In the case of the Booker and Workman plots, they served as inspiration for larger projects shown in different folders of this portfolio (NBA Shiny App and Example Catching Report)

• Bonds Plot: Details the 1998 home run race between Sammy Sosa, Barry Bonds, and Luis Gonzalez, using a function that sums total home runs by date (fun.sum function)

• Workman plot: Pulled Statcast data from August 2019 and plotted pitch type and pitch result within the strike zone geom object explained in the textbook "Analyzing Baseball Data with R"

• Devin Booker Plots: Booker bar plot exemplifies limitation of bar plots to one attribute (3PA), while the density plot shows overlay capabilites when contrasting 2 or more attributes (3PA vs 2PA)

• NBA Residual Plot: Depicts a ggplot rendering of NBA team residuals (Observed - Expected pythagorean wins) from 2017 - 2020. Highlighted teams show the most extreme residuals, aka the teams that over and under performed the most
