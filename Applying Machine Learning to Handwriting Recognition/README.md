# Handwriting Recognition in R (kNN, SVM, and Random Forest Modeling)

## This project was completed for the graduate Data Science class - "Applied Machine Learning"

### A few notes about the project:

• 4198 observations of 785 variables with 'pixel' variables used to predict handwriting samples from a variety of contexts
• Accuracy of .9212 for kNN, .9026 for SVM, and .9266 for Random Forest all with 5 fold cross-validation
• Based on the accuracy results and runtime, the Random Forest option seems to work best with this type of pixelated data
