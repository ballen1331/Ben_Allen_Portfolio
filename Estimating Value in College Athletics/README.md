# Estimating Value in College Athletics

## Project completed for the class SAL 366 "Sport Economics II"

### Notes about the data:

• Dataset of 1000 individual college football seasons for power 5 teams (2006-2015), with attributes about recruiting, future NFL draft status, scheduling, team points, and entertainment scores, seeking to gain insight into the factors that influence financial success of a college football program.

• Specifically, the goal is to isolate the recruiting and NFL draft metrics in an attempt to quantify a monetary equivalent of elite college football player/s.

### Model Results and Conclusions:

• Three-level quantile regression revealed to varying degrees of certainty that our 'playersall' beta, which counts the number of future drafted players on that team's roster, correlates to somewhere in between $1,500,000 - $2,300,000 in future program earnings per highly drafted player. 

• A separate 2SLS model taking into account college specific effects (i.e Alabama, Georgia, Ohio State) estimates an elite player at a top tier program to correspond to reach as high as $6,000,000 for schools like Alabama, Georgia, and Ohio State. 

• Without taking into account program effects, a third lagged recruiting model estimates a more modest value of $965,000 per elite player, which seems to be the most accurate value when taking out external factors

• Overall, this unique dataset provided by Dr. Jeremy Losak allowed us to analyze the types of features that modern sport economists in the collegiate sports world try to tackle all the time.
