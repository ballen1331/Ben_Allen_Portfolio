# Spotify Analysis in Python

## This project was completed with classmate Vaibhav Chaudari, as a final assessment for IST 652 (Scripting for Data Analysis)

### A few notes about the data

• Data was obtained from a few different Spotify APIs in json and csv format, both of which provided around 30,000 characteristics related to song popularity (artist, song, streams, days in top 100, mentions, popularity score, etc.) in addition to song characteristics (genre, beat, frequency, notes, etc.)

• The goal was to answer the question: Who has been the most dominant artists over the past 20 years? And what characteristics do those artists/songs encompass?

• Upon cleaning our data in pandas, we created a few graphics and summary tables that help tell a story about each artist we chose to analyze (Drake, Eminem, Rihanna, Bad Bunny, Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, etc.)

• Based on streaming volume and popularity scores visualized across the entire sample period (views, views / track, # of hit songs, popularity score), we found the found dominant artist to be Drake

• In addition, we were able to make predictions about future dominant artists and concluded that Bad Bunny and Ed Sheeran were the most likely artists to dominate the next 20 years of music
