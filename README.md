# Ben_Allen_Portfolio
This repository is a culmination of both academic and outside research projects I have completed over the past few years, as a Sport Analytics (B.S) and Applied Data Science (M.S) student at Syracuse University.

Within each project folder, you'll find a readme file similar to this one that details each individual project. 

Feel free to reach out to me on linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/benallen1331/) or email at ballen06@syr.edu if you have any questions. Enjoy!
