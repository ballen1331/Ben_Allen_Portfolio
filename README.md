# My Portfolio
My name is Ben Allen, and this repository is a culmination of both academic and outside research projects I have completed over the past few years as a Sport Analytics (B.S) and Applied Data Science (M.S) student at Syracuse University.

Within each project folder, you'll find applicable data files, R Markdowns, Jupyter Notebooks, and final papers/plots as well as README files similar to this one that detail the results and conclusions of each individual project. 

Feel free to reach out to me on linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/benallen1331/) or email at ballen06@syr.edu if you would like to connect. Enjoy!
