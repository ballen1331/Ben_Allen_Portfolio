# NBA Shot Chart Shiny App

## This project was completed with Daniel Beim as a final assignment for the class "R for Sport Analytics"

### A few notes about the data:

• The data contains around 103,000 individual shots obtained from the nbastatR API, and it's limited to Western Pacific Division teams from the 2018 - 2020 NBA seasons, as that is around R Shiny's rendering limit. 

• Key Attributes include the following:  Player/Team Name, Shot Event/Action (Made Shot / Jump Shot), 

• The final data file ("PacificShots2.csv") was too large to fit in GitHub, but can be obtained by running the "SAL 413 Project Data Scrape.Rmd file" 

  Attributes  ShotType (dunk, layup, 3-pointer)
