# NBA Shot Chart Shiny App

I competed this project with Daniel Beim as a final assignment for the class "R for Sport Analytics"

A few notes about the project:

-The final data file "PacificShots2.csv" was too large to fit in GitHub, but can be obtained by running the first portion of the script above
-The data contains shot attributes like ShotType (dunk, layup, 3-pointer)
