# NBA Shot Chart Shiny App

I competed this project with Daniel Beim as a final assignment for the class "R for Sport Analytics"

A few notes about the project:

•The final data file "PacificShots2.csv" was too large to fit in GitHub, but can be obtained by running the first portion of the script above
•The data contains around 103,000 individual shots from the 2018 - 2020 NBA seasons.
