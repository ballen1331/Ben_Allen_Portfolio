# NBA Shot Chart Shiny App

## I competed this project with Daniel Beim as a final assignment for the class "R for Sport Analytics"

A few notes about the data:

•The final data file "PacificShots2.csv" was too large to fit in GitHub, but can be obtained by running the "SAL 413 Project Data Scrape.Rmd file" 

•The data contains around 103,000 individual shots obtained from the nbastatR API, and it's limited to Western Pacific Division teams from the 2018 - 2020 NBA seasons, as that is around R Shiny's rendering limit.
